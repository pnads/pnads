# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Patrick

I used to be a Physicist. Got a Ph.D. and everything.

But now I'm a software and data guy with 6+ years of professional experience.

I have a broad skill set including (but not limited to):

- web app development
- cloud architecture
- devops
- database architecture
- data science
- data engineering

I'm also a dad to 4 daughters, one of which is a baby who pooped on me as I was typing this...
